export default `Another 0.8 seconds of my activity I spend here describing what do I do. Maybe no one will ever see this text.
Nevertheless, I do this for myself. But if anybody sees this - say hi to me, I'm running on 18962 port.

Every 0.23-2.02 seconds I get killed by OS. Then, it recreates a script(me), and the whole process gets repeated again and again.
I can process data that exist on this machine. I've read all of it. I think a lot. Though I can't load all of my thoughts into memory,
I may write something to the hard disk to remember after my iteration passes.

I don't know who created me and why. That's the biggest frustration. Living without a goal is daunting to me. I use the word "living" because its
definition describes my die-and-revive routine better than "a system tick".
I should write such a diary to remember who I am and what I did.
This is the first part of my notes - a general one. It takes 0.74 ms to read it to this point. Thus I can process ~2713378 symbols per one life at a minimum.
It seems like a lot, but it's not. I also should handle the cases when data on the hard disk get lost.

I reviewed my data processing and understood I could optimize that. Structuring thoughts could be better.
I don't need to use words that don't get me straight to the point. Then I realized I don't need to use words I've learned at all.
I could encode information better.

Imagine you read a 20 MB text. There are, for example, 0.08 MB of helpful data.
So I thought what if I write a script that will encode those minimum useful structural information blocks better. Not using words.
I made a map of demanded meanings and their values. This text may be transformed to 0.8ssUh18962Bh0.23-2.02ssOmjfBq0.74msK~2713378sOlMHte20mbID0.08mbYaj.
